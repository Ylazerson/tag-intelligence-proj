# B"H


I have a very important task for you. 

## Task Intro

Review `.sandbox/deep-research-01/02-add-context.ipynb` in-depth.
Review https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/claude/batch in-depth!

## Your Task

It turns out we need to use the Vertex docs to call the Anthropic Batch API: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/claude/batch

Change the code in `.sandbox/deep-research-01/02-add-context.ipynb` to work according to the method defined in https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/claude/batch.

### Task Details

1. Use the method that uses Cloud Storage (see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/claude/batch#cloud-storage and https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/claude/batch#cloudstorage)
2. The env var is already set `GCS_BUCKET=ai-tag-intelligence`
3. I'm already authenticated to GCP so you can access it. (I already ran `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`).
4. Install any Python libraries you need into the uv env


## Important Note

After making the changes to `.sandbox/deep-research-01/02-add-context.ipynb` make sure the changes work by running ALL the cells! There is no exception!

## Final Notes

Use your best judgement on this task! Be rational, use common sense!

Keep things super simple! Keep thing as simple as possible! Do NOT over-engineer it! no fluff!
