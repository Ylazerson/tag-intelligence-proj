# B"H


I have a very important task for you. 


I have the following AWS Resource ID: `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:026631811025:instance/i-0e1889bc111796b48`

This resource has the following user tag: `"faro:deployment": "sxe-webui-infrastructure-sxe27"`


I need you to do research to find out, using aws cli commands, what each part of the tag key and tag value refer to. 

Put the research results into tag-research-results.md file. I need you to explain each aspect of the tag value and what aws command you needed to deduce that (or whether it was obvious without needing any aws command etc.)

I have already set aws pointed to that 026631811025 account, so you can use aws cli now.
