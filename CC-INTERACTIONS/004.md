# B"H


I have a very important task for you. 

## Your Task

I have the following AWS Resource ID: `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:026631811025:instance/i-0e1889bc111796b48`

This resource has the following user tag: `"faro:deployment": "sxe-webui-infrastructure-sxe27"`

I need you to find out, using aws cli commands, what the `sxe` part of the tag value refers to. 

Use aws commands to research/learn about what the `sxe` part of the tag value means.

Create a file sxe-research.md with the results.

## Important Notes

- After every aws command you need to add `--profile assumed`. For example `aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-tag-values --region us-east-1 --key "faro:deployment" --output json --profile assumed`.
- I have already set aws pointed to that 026631811025 account.

## Final Notes

Use your best judgement on this task! Be rational, use common sense!

Keep things super simple! Keep thing as simple as possible! Do NOT over-engineer it! no fluff!
