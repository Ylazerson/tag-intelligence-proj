# B"H


I have a very important task for you. 

## Your Task

I have the following AWS Resource ID: `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:026631811025:instance/i-0e1889bc111796b48`

This resource has the following user tag: `"faro:deployment": "sxe-webui-infrastructure-sxe27"`

I need to find out, using aws cli commands, what each part of the tag key and tag value refer to. 

What are some aws commands I can run that would help me learn about what each component of the tag `"faro:deployment": "sxe-webui-infrastructure-sxe27"` means?

## Important Notes

- After every aws command you need to add `--profile assumed`. For example `aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-tag-values --region us-east-1 --key "faro:deployment" --output json --profile assumed`.
- I have already set aws pointed to that 026631811025 account.

## Final Notes
